<h1 align="left">Tech News</h1>

###

<p align="left">This project aims to query a website that contains news about technology. To do this, data scraping was used, which is a technique for collecting data from online platforms. The data is captured from the scripts that are generated by the pages and programs that ‚Äúscrape‚Äù the information. After the scraping is finished, the data is saved in a database.<br><br>With the data already saved and structured, the program allows to search by title, date, tags and news category.<br><br>An interactive menu is available so that the user can do the processes more easily.</p>
